The Carroll Award for Innovation
2025 Call for Proposals: Artificial Intelligence
The Peter R. Carroll Award for Innovation was created to reflect Dr. Carroll’s passion for provocative
ideas that challenge the status quo and his expansive commitment to the university. The Carroll Award
for Innovation seeks to support junior investigators whose research aligns with Carroll’s passion and
dedication. We encourage bold and disruptive research ideas that are often considered too high-risk by
traditional grant sources. The Carroll Award for Innovation aims to allow our brightest and boldest junior
faculty to pursue research projects that lead to transformative change.
The Peter Carroll Innovation Fund issues its call for proposals biannually. The theme of the 2025 call
is artificial intelligence. Funding can be requested up to $100,000. Two projects will be funded with
an expected duration of up to two years.
Eligibility
• The Carroll Award for Innovation is open to Assistant Professors at or below Step 3 (or
equivalent) as of June 30, 2025.
• Non-clinical faculty are eligible to apply.
• Applicants must have full-time appointments at UCSF, including appointments at the Gladstone
Institute or the VA.
2025 Theme: Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence, and in particular the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), has
ignited interest in how these new technologies can pioneer new biomedical discoveries in the areas of
diagnostics and therapeutics, as well as solutions that improve healthcare delivery and population health.
For this call, applications that use or advance AI across the continuum of discovery science, clinical
science, and population health will be considered. Competitive applications will specifically approach AI
as a driver of paradigmatic shifts in their field. Illustrative examples include:
• Projects that advance methods or applications to shift from AI targeting discrete clinical decisions
and processes (current paradigm) to those that can manage complex, interdependent systems
(future paradigm)
• Developing and applying AI approaches to improve diagnostic or therapeutic strategies by
leveraging data across scales (genetic, proteomic, tissue, clinical)
• Projects that use AI to investigate how socioeconomic factors can be leveraged to reduce disease
burden or improve clinical care.
Proposal Instructions
Proposal Format: Proposals should consist of the following:
1. Cover Page: Cover page with the name of the award (“PC 2025 Award”), applicant’s name,
academic title(s), department, phone number(s), and email address(es).
2. Biosketch: An NIH Biosketch, including a personal statement for the applicant, tailored to the
application. Please call out current or submitted funding related to the proposed project.
3. Project Description: Description (two pages or less, inclusive of figures) of the proposed
research, including the following sections: (a) Context and Motivation – describe the current
paradigm, future paradigm, and how the planned project contributes to progress toward future
paradigm; (b) Approach – describe project plan including a concise timeline; (c) Resources
and Environment – please describe mentors, collaborators, or other research infrastructure
necessary for the success of the project. Note: References may be on a third page.
Additional materials, including letters of support, should not be included. Proposals should be
submitted as a single PDF to Carolyn Remick (Carolyn.Remick@ucsf.edu) no later than June 12,
2025 (noon PDT).
Selection Process
A diverse advisory committee will review proposals and share recommendations for priority consideration
with the Chancellor, who will make the final decision.
Selection Criteria
• Significance: Will the project advance a new paradigm in the specified field? Is the new paradigm
likely to have a near-term (3-5 years) impact on a significant clinical or biomedical problem?
• Methodological Rigor: The project involves robust methodologies.
• Feasibility: Are the proposed methods feasible even if the project is high-risk? Are there key
enabling resources and environment available? Is the timeline reasonable?
Questions about the Carroll Innovation Award program should be addressed to Carolyn Remick.
